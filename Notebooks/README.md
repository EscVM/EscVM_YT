# 1.0 Getting Started

## 1.1 Installation

Installation it's very straightforward, and it takes only a couple of minutes.

Firstly, you can start cloning the whole repository:

1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EscVM/EscVM_YT.git
   ```

Then, requirements  depend on from which set of notebooks you would like to play with. However, whichever set you want to use, navigate into its folder and install the requirements libraries with:

2. Install the required packages
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**N.B.**: Peek inside the requirements file if you have everything already installed. Most of the dependencies are common libraries. Finally, as always, it is better to work and install dependencies inside a nice and cozy virtualenv.
